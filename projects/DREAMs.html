                            a polymer that increases interlayer adhesion with FDM materials to increase the structural
                            strength of printed parts. Designed a custom ink reservoir in SolidWorks to increase the

            <h3>Research Area</h3>
            <p>
                This project worked around an additive manufacturing device that integrates FDM and inkjet allowing
                for complex integrated parts to be printed which otherwise would not be possible. One major
                application for this technology is the use of the inkjet nozzles as a plasticizers to allow for
                stronger adhesion between layers. Furthermore, this technology can be expanded to electronics with
                the introduction of conductive inks that would allow for traces to be built into the part. This
                enables PCBs to be printed directly into the part, reducing the need for assembly and increasing
                the structural integrity of the part.
            </p>
            <h3>Challenges Faced</h3>
            <p>
                The first major challenge faced with this project involved the hardware hacking of the machine. Since
                this machine was a legacy 3D printer, there was no documentation on the hardware or software. This
                meant having to experiment with the proprietary file created by the slicer. After understanding the
                methodology behind the file, I was able to create a python script that would allow me to create my own
                instruction sets for the part.
                <br><br>
                The second challenge involved the integration of the actual ink with the system. This system was
                heavily locked down with chips integrated onto all disposable parts. This meant in order to use our
                inks, we needed to trick the system into thinking it was using the original ink. This was done by
                bypassing the ink cartridge and directly filling the ink reservoir with our ink.
                <br><br>
                The final challenge was understanding the chemical properties of the materials we utilized as an ink.
                When working with some inks, we realized the surface tension was too high causing the
                piezoelectric ink heads to get jammed and not push any ink out. This was solved by looking using the
                Wendell and Reynolds number to determine the surface tension of the ink and how it would behave in the
                system.
