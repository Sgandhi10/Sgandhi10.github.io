                        <p>
                            Created an application that allows users to go to a website and understand the people they
                            should contact if they wish to take action on a certain issue. Used OpenAI's GPT-3 to
                            determine the best politician to contact based on the committees and subcommittees they are
                            a part of. Used Flask to integrate the front end with the backend and BeautifulSoup2 to
                            scrape data from the website. Won Most Innovative Hack by Bloomberg.

            <h3>Inspiration</h3>
            <p>
                Throughout their upbringing, political
                events have deeply influenced every member of the Politilink team. From local government to the
                national stage, the actions of our country's politicians can
                profoundly impact the daily lives of its citizens. In our modern world, dominated by technology and
                social media, it's easy to feel overwhelmed and overshadowed by the countless voices on the internet. At
                times, advocating for one's beliefs may even seem futile.
                <br><br>
                We firmly believe that every voice holds significance. Regardless of geographical location,
                party affiliation, or the number of opposing voters, we maintain that a single voice has the power to
                bring about tangible change in the real world. Politilink goes beyond being a mere tool to connect
                people with Congress; it serves as a reminder that the voice of the voter is just as vital as any other.
                Sometimes, the greatest waves of transformation begin with small ripples.
            </p>
            <h3>Solution</h3>
            <p>
                Politilink is a user-friendly Google Chrome extension that examines the introduction of an article and
                provides the relevant contact information for Congress members associated with the topic. The extension
                presents a comprehensive list of email addresses, phone numbers, and Twitter handles in a simple and
                understandable format.
                <br><br>
                This innovative solution tackles a common challenge faced by American citizens who seek to engage with
                the political sphere. Extensively researching every issue to identify the politicians involved in
                matters affecting our daily lives can be arduous and time-consuming. Moreover, locating the precise
                means of contacting them can pose an additional hurdle. Politilink effectively addresses this problem by
                offering a convenient and efficient way for individuals to connect with their representatives and
                express their opinions.

            <h3>Challenges</h3>
            <h4>Javascript Front-End</h4>
            <p>
                When developing this application one of the biggest challenges that we faced involved working with
                the ChatGPT API in javascript. The majority of the team was unfamiliar with Javascript, which led to us
                struggling when trying to implement web scraping and api calls to ChatGPT. To overcome this, we
                utilized Flask to leverage our strengths in Python and integrate the front end with the backend.
            </p>
            <h4>ChatGPT Output</h4>
            <p>
                Another big issue we faced when working with ChatGPT was the output format. For some reason, the API
                returned different formats each time the API was called. To overcome this, we did some
                prompt-engineering to create a custom prompt that would specify the format in which the output should
                be as well as ensuring ChatGPT understood the input.
