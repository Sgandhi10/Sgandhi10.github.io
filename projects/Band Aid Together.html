                            Developed an utilizing Google Firebase to notify others if a person is having a seizure.
                            The app was developed using Android Studio and an Arduino MKR 1010 Wi-Fi with an EMG
                            sensor attached to provide live data to the app. The app was developed in Kotlin and the
                            Arduino code was developed in C++. The app won Best Hardware Hack for its use of hardware
                            components & UT Prosim Hack for its potential to help others.

                    <h3>Inspiration</h3>
                    <p>
                        Nearly a month ago, we had a close friend experience a panic attack in an isolated area. When we
                        saw the unfortunate effects of this incident on him, we were inspired to find a way to link one
                        to their loved ones and help them get through it. Upon further research, we found out that women
                        and mothers are disproportionately more likely to suffer from routine panic attacks and anxiety,
                        especially in the Pandemic Era. Panic attacks and anxiety have also been linked to an increase
                        in seizures.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Challenges</h3>
                    <h4>Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)</h4>
                    <p>
                        We initially chose the Arduino Nano 33 IoT's BLE module as our communication link to the mobile
                        application. BLE appeared to be the ideal choice for our implementation due to its low latency
                        and long-lasting performance. However, we encountered several challenges during the BLE
                        implementation, both in terms of code and security. On the code side, we faced difficulties
                        securing a GATT connection with the mobile phone because the phone's MAC address would change
                        periodically. Additionally, there were issues with correctly reading UUID characteristics even
                        when the connection was established. From a security perspective, the Nano device lacked
                        robustness in a central-to-peripheral framework, as anyone could connect using the MAC address
                        and access the BLE's characteristics. Initially, we considered encryption but eventually opted
                        for a cloud-based solution, which successfully resolved all our problems. As part of this
                        transition, we also switched to the Arduino MKR WiFi 1010 board, as it facilitated streamlined
                        communication with the mobile app via the cloud. This switch not only reduced latency but also
                        addressed our security concerns effectively.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Firebase</h4>
                    <p>
                        One of the primary hurdles we encountered revolved around the implementation of Google Firebase.
                        We recognized that adopting a cloud-based solution had the potential to alleviate several of the
                        challenges associated with BLE. However, we encountered difficulties, particularly concerning
                        the compatibility of Firebase with the Nano device. This compelled us to transition to an
                        alternative option, the Arduino MKR WiFi 1010. By utilizing specific libraries, we successfully
                        established a connection between Arduino and Firebase. A similar integration was achieved with
                        Android Studio, enabling us to develop a system where the Arduino transmitted time and sensor
                        data securely to the cloud, while the mobile app accessed and utilized this information
                        accordingly.
