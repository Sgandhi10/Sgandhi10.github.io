                <h3>Mission</h3>
                <p>
                    The goal behind our project is to help students in our local neighbor and help people around the
                    world get the gift of sight by donating to <a href="http://giftofvision.in/index.php">Sankara Eye
                    Foundation</a>.
                </p>
                <h3>Motivation</h3>
                <p>
                    I come from a family that always believed in the best education, and my parents always made sure to
                    give me the resources they could to help me succeed. However, I have realized that not every student
                    is afforded with the same opportunities and I wanted to help them. That is why I started
                    Teach4Charity, an initiative that gave students tutoring at an affordable price and donated all the
                    proceeds to charity. We accepted any student no matter their financial situation, and we were able
                    to
                    help them succeed in their classes.
                </p>
                <h3>Accomplishments</h3>
                <p>
                    Through this project we were able to help over 50 students in a variety of grades and subjects. We
                    were able to raise over $4,000 dollars for charity and help over 100 people get the gift of
                    sight. This initiative was also able to provide materials to the local elementary school and help
                    them with their STEM program. This program also provided 10+ tutors a way to give back to the
                    community in a fun and impactful way.
