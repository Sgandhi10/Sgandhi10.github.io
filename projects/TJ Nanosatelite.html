                        <h2>TJ REVERB</h2>
                        <p>
                            The TJ Space program is a high school club working with professionals from GMU, NASA, and
                            other
                            organizations to build and design cubesats. TJ REVERB is a 2U cubesat launched in
                            November 29th, 2022 on SpaceX CRS-26 and deployed December 29th from the International Space
                            Station. The cubesat is a 2U satellite testing the Iridium network in
                            space. The Iridium network is a network of satellites that provide global communication.
                            Currently, the Iridium network is primarily used on the surface of Earth, but the TJ
                            REVERB mission
                            will test the network in space. The Iridium network will also be utilized to geolocate
                            the cubesat's position in space based on relative location to satellites.
                        </p>

            <h3>Current Status</h3>
            <p>
                As of today (May 2023), the TJREVERB was not 100% successful. The cubesat was deployed from the
                ISS, after which a full power system failure occurred. The cubesat is currently providing a live
                update through a heart beat on the Sat-4 system providing us with the current location of the
                cubesat. The cubesat is currently in a stable orbit and is expected to stay in orbit for 2-3 years.
                The TJREVERB mission is still considered a success as the cubesat was able to be deployed and
                is providing a live update. However, due to the power system failure, the cubesat is not able to
                provide the full functionality of the mission.
            </p>
            <h3>Roles</h3>
            <h4>Sat-4 Lead</h4>
            <p>
                As the SAT-4 Lead for the TJREVERB mission, I was responsible for leading the team's development with
                the primary radio system. The primary radio system is a tested platform known to work under space
                conditions providing a way to communicate with the cubesat in scenarios where the Iridium network
                is not available.
            </p>
            <h4>Electronics Subteam</h4>
            <p>
                As a member of the electronics sub-team I spent a majority of my time working on the power system
                for the cubesat. The power system is a critical component of the cubesat as it is responsible for
                providing power to all the subsystems. The power system is also responsible for charging the
                batteries utilizing the solar panels during the day and managing power consumption as well as
                power output to each subsystem through relays which designate different modes based on current
                battery levels.
            </p>
            <h4>BlueCube Lead</h4>
            <p>
                When starting out on the TJREVERB mission, I was the BlueCube Lead. The BlueCube is an outreach
                initiative by the TJ Space Program to provide a platform for other high school students to learn
                about cubesats through interactive demonstrations and physical models which can be utilized to
                interact with our Cubesat as well as understand the elements that go into building a fully
                functioning Cubesat. As the BlueCube Lead, I was responsible for leading the development of the
                prototype BlueCube as well as the development of the curriculum for the BlueCube. This role
                entailed reach out to foreign and local high school space programs to provide them with the
                opportunity to learn about cubesats and the TJREVERB mission as well as providing them with the
                opportunity to learn more.
